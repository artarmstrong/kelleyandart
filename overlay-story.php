                <h2>Her Version</h2>
                <p>As many of you know at the end of June my family and I would go on an Annual Camping trip, known as 4th Weekend. This is where Art and I had first met around 10 years ago. I guess I should thank my dad for starting this tradition, or I never would have met my wonderful fiancé! Although we had known each other for a long time, our story began the summer I moved home from college.</p>
                <p>I had a suspicion that Art kinda liked me, but he never told me how he felt. Well when he finally did, I shut him down…3 times! Obviously I wasn’t thinking. I soon started thinking about this handsome, funny, kind guy who shared my interests and that I always loved hanging out with. So to tell him I did what any other classy girl would do, I got him drunk! Luckily this was on St. Patrick’s Day so it wasn’t too hard.</p>
                <p>We had gone out with some of our teammates after our first soccer game of the season. And since my apartment was conveniently in walking distance from the bar, he decided to sleep it off. That was my chance, now or never, so I kissed him! The BEST last first kiss I will ever have! From then on we were pretty inseparable. And I could not be happier!</p>

                <h2>His Version</h2>
                
                <p>I first met Kelley on our annual camping trip and after seeing her beautiful smile and great personality I knew that I liked her and make as much effort as I could to keep this girl in my life. Over the next few years we saw each other occasionally but luckily never lost touch for very long.</p>
                <p>After I finished school and moved to the Seattle area we started to talk more and I made it a point to see her whenever she came back into town on breaks or holidays from school. Not to long after I found out she was moving back to Washington after graduating and I couldn't help but be excited to see her more often.</p>
                <p>Once she was back in Washington I started to make my move but for her own delusional reasons she wasn't ready so I did all I could do...keep at it! After 3 times of being shut down I gave up. Then out of no where after a soccer game on St. Paddys day the team went out to have a few drinks and Kelley kept buying me more drinks. Well I couldn't drive home so I stayed the night at her place right down the street. She made her move, we kissed, and the rest is history and I couldn't be happier!</p>
